Algebraic Multigrid Solver Optimization

This repository contains Python programs and benchmarks developed to analyze and optimize the performance of an algebraic multigrid solver using manual tuning and LLM-assisted code enhancements. The solver leverages PyAMG's smoothed aggregation methods, with improvements focused on memory usage and execution speed.

Insights from Profiling

    Manual Optimization: Major improvements in memory usage; the main bottleneck is eigenvalue computations.
    LLM-based Optimization: Effective at smaller scales; dominated at larger scales by iterative solver (CG).

Next Steps

    Implement a native C/C++ conjugate gradient solver to further enhance performance.
    Explore additional LLM models and prompts for better optimization strategies.
    Integrate C/C++ extensions to optimize critical solver functions for significant execution time improvements.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    PyAMG
    SciPy
    SnakeViz (recommended for profiling)
